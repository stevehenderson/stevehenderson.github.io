Secure Boot is a rather cryptic and opaque security setting on your computer.  In most circumstances, it's something you or your computer's vendor will configure in your machine's BIOS, and then forget about.  Occasionally, you might be tempted to disable this setting to facilitate custom boot scenarios, install certain hardware, or peform botique configurations to your machine.  However, Secure Boot is an essential protection mechanism to help keep your computer safe from the most dangerous and sophisticated cyber security threats.

## Overview of secure boot

Secure Boot is a security standard developed by the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Forum. 
It is used to ensure that a device boots using only software that is trusted by the manufacturer. During the boot process, the firmware checks each piece of software against a database of known good code. If any software is found to be untrusted or tampered with, the boot process is halted. This mechanism helps prevent unauthorized code from running at startup, effectively mitigating risks associated with rootkits, bootkits, and other forms of malware that attempt to compromise a system before the operating system has a chance to load.


## Detecting Secure Boot

As a developer, it's often helpful to audit the machine your code is running on to determine if secureboot is enabled.  In Linux you can write a go program that does just that:


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"
	"strings"
)

// checkSecureBoot checks if Secure Boot is enabled by reading the appropriate EFI variable.
func checkSecureBoot() (bool, error) {
	secureBootPath := "/sys/firmware/efi/efivars/SecureBoot-*"

	files, err := filepath.Glob(secureBootPath)
	if err != nil {
		return false, fmt.Errorf("failed to read Secure Boot variable: %v", err)
	}

	for _, file := range files {
		data, err := os.ReadFile(file)
		if err != nil {
			return false, fmt.Errorf("failed to read file %s: %v", file, err)
		}

		// Check the contents to determine if Secure Boot is enabled
		if strings.Contains(string(data), "1") {
			return true, nil
		}
	}

	return false, nil
}

func main() {
	enabled, err := checkSecureBoot()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
		return
	}

	if enabled {
		fmt.Println("Secure Boot is enabled.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Secure Boot is not enabled.")
	}
}
```
